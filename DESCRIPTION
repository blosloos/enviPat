Description: Fast and very memory-efficient calculation of isotope patterns,
    subsequent convolution to theoretical envelopes (profiles) plus valley
    detection and centroidization or intensoid calculation. Batch processing,
    resolution interpolation, wrapper, adduct calculations and molecular
    formula parsing.
